## Next Steps

### Getting Started

1. **Review the epics** - Understand each epic's scope and dependencies
2. **Set up environment** - Follow [Installation Guide](/docs/installation)
3. **Read architecture docs** - Understand [System Architecture](/docs/architecture)
4. **Start with Epic 1** - Foundation must be solid before building features

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd codebase-underway
pnpm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your database URL

# Database setup
pnpm prisma generate
pnpm prisma db push

# Start development
pnpm dev
```

### Best Practices

- ✅ Always scope queries by `schoolId`
- ✅ Write tests for multi-tenant isolation
- ✅ Use TypeScript strictly
- ✅ Follow the [Architecture Patterns](/docs/pattern)
- ✅ Document as you build
- ✅ Review [PRD](/docs/prd) for detailed requirements
