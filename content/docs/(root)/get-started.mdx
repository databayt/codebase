## The Idea

Building a school automation platform like these real-world products:

1. [OpenEduCat](https://openeducat.org/) - Open source education management
2. [Pioneers E-School](https://pioneerseschool.com/) - Comprehensive school system
3. [PowerSchool](https://www.powerschool.com/) - $2.8B valuation, 45M students
4. [Infinite Campus](https://www.infinitecampus.com/) - 7.8M students, 50 US states

_See more companies at [Competitors](/docs/competitors)._
