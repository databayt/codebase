## Executive Summary

The global education sector manages over 2 million schools serving 1.5 billion students, yet 78% still rely on paper-based or fragmented digital systems. This inefficiency costs the industry $12B annually in wasted administrative processes, with each administrator losing 40 hours monthly to manual tasks. Meanwhile, 65% of parents express dissatisfaction with school communication, and manual attendance/grade tracking suffers from a 23% error rate.

Hogwarts is envisioned as the world's most comprehensive, accessible, and user-friendly school management platform—a true operating system for educational institutions. We will revolutionize school administration by providing an all-in-one, cloud-based solution that serves schools, teachers, students, and parents globally.

### What Makes This Special

Hogwarts isn't just another school management system—it's a **magical transformation** of educational operations:

  <div className="p-6 border rounded-lg">
    <h4>Truly Unified Platform</h4>
    <p className="text-muted-foreground">Unlike competitors offering fragmented modules, Hogwarts provides seamless integration from student enrollment to financial management in one cohesive experience.</p>

  <div className="p-6 border rounded-lg">
    <h4>Modern Architecture, Legacy-Free</h4>
    <p className="text-muted-foreground">Built on Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript with true multi-tenancy, we're 10x faster to develop and infinitely more scalable than legacy platforms stuck on outdated tech stacks.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="p-6 border rounded-lg">
    <h4>Enterprise Features at SMB Prices</h4>
    <p className="text-muted-foreground">Advanced capabilities like double-entry bookkeeping, comprehensive payroll, and AI-powered analytics typically reserved for expensive enterprise systems—offered at 1/10th the cost.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="p-6 border rounded-lg">
    <h4>Open-Source Heart</h4>
    <p className="text-muted-foreground">Community-driven development with transparent codebase, allowing schools to customize, contribute, and truly own their data.</p>
  </div>
</div>

**The Magic**: Imagine a world where school administrators spend their time improving education instead of fighting with software, where parents feel connected to their children's learning journey, and where teachers have the tools to truly personalize instruction. That's the Hogwarts promise.

## SaaS B2B Specific Requirements

Hogwarts operates as a multi-tenant SaaS platform serving schools as business customers.

### Multi-Tenancy Architecture

**Subdomain-Based Tenant Isolation:**
```
Production:     school.databayt.org → /[lang]/s/school/...

Development:    subdomain.localhost:3000 → /[lang]/s/subdomain/...
Custom Domain:  www.theirschool.com (CNAME) → Hogwarts platform
```

**Data Isolation Strategy:**
- Every database model includes mandatory `schoolId` field
- All Prisma queries MUST include `where: { schoolId }` filter
- Unique constraints scoped per tenant: `@@unique([schoolId, email])`
- Automated test suite verifies no cross-tenant data leaks
- Audit trails log `schoolId` + `requestId` for every operation

4. **STUDENT** - View own grades, attendance, submit assignments
5. **GUARDIAN** (Parent) - View linked students' data, communicate with teachers, pay fees
6. **ACCOUNTANT** - Manage finances, generate financial reports (no academic data access)
7. **STAFF** (Non-teaching) - Limited operational module access (library, transport, hostel)
