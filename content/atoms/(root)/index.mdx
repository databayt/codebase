description: codebase is a set of beautifully-designed, accessible components and a code distribution platform.

**This is not a component library. It is how you build your component library.**

You know how most traditional component libraries work: you install a package from NPM, import the components, and use them in your app.

This approach works well until you need to customize a component to fit your design system or require one that isn't included in the library.

This is what codebase aims to solve. It is built around the following principles:

- **Open Code:** The top layer of your component code is open for modification.
- **Composition:** Every component uses a common, composable interface, making them predictable.
- **Distribution:** A flat-file schema and command-line tool make it easy to distribute components.
- **Beautiful Defaults:** Carefully chosen default styles, so you get great design out-of-the-box.
- **AI-Ready:** Open code for LLMs to read, understand, and improve.

## Open Code

codebase hands you the actual component code. You have full control to customize and extend the components to your needs.

## Composition

Every component in codebase shares a common, composable interface. If a component does not exist, we bring it in, make it composable, and adjust its style to match.

## Distribution

codebase is also a code distribution system. It defines a schema for components and a CLI to distribute them.

## Beautiful Defaults

codebase comes with a large collection of components that have carefully chosen default styles.

## AI-Ready

The design of codebase makes it easy for AI tools to work with your code.
