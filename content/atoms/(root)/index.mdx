description: A collection of beautifully-designed, accessible UI atoms built with shadcn/ui components. Copy-paste ready components for your React applications.

**Atoms are the smallest, reusable building blocks for your React applications.**

These are not traditional components from a package you install. They are copy-paste components built on top of shadcn/ui primitives that you can customize to fit your needs.

## What are Atoms?

Atoms follow atomic design principles - they are the fundamental building blocks that combine shadcn/ui components with custom styling and behavior. Each atom is:

- **Copy-Paste Ready:** Get the exact code to drop into your project
- **Built on shadcn/ui:** Leverages the power of Radix UI primitives
- **Fully Customizable:** Open code that you can modify to fit your design system
- **Accessible:** Built with accessibility in mind from the ground up
- **Modern:** Uses the latest React patterns and TypeScript

## How to Use

1. Browse the atoms collection
2. Copy the component code
3. Paste into your project
4. Customize as needed

Each atom page includes:

- Live preview of the component
- Complete source code
- Installation instructions for dependencies
- Usage examples
- Customization tips

## Philosophy

Atoms are designed to be:

- **Composable:** Combine atoms to create more complex components
- **Consistent:** Share a common design language and API
- **Flexible:** Easy to adapt to your specific use case
- **Maintainable:** Clear, readable code that's easy to understand

Start exploring atoms to build your component library from the ground up.
